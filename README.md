This repo is based on github.com/passenger-stack's 'Passenger' repository. <br>
I created it for studying purposes to learn about .NET Core, ASP.NET, C#, Git, and concepts such as:
* Authentication & Authorization
* Caching
* Commands and Command Handlers
* CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Separation)
* DDD (Domain Driven Design)
* DI (Dependency Injection)
* DTO (Data Transfer Object)
* IoC (Inversion of Control)
* JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* Mocks & Stubs
* MVC (Model-View-Controller)
* Onion Architecture
* REST (Representational State Transfer)
* RWS (RESTful Web Services)
* TDD (Test Driven Design) <br>
and many more.

If you're new to any of these concepts, I wholeheartedly encourage you to check out the 'original' repo, that is, 'Passenger' by @passenger-stack.
